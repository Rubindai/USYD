Hi 
dummy.py is my fake client to send messages to server
Coverage is viewable in html
I use diff to display any inconsistency between test.out and between.actual
run.sh may take a while to complete(about one minute to run because of the delay I set)
I learned a lot and my code is better then A1(at least what i think:p), it's been a wild run as this is my first semester, but I am glad I take it.
Thx for reading through my code :)
