There are 4 test users.
1. user. The default user on Ed, I didn't create a sub-folder for this. The testcases are pretty comprehensive
2. elaine. mainly about no task to finish
3. john. no meetings.md/no tasks.md file
4. rubin. json master directoy not found.
All tests are done on ed so it should be compatible. It's half auto, all script can be accessed under test folder.
It's my first semester, I did learn a lot through this assignment.
